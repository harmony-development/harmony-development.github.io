## Why Harmony?

### Simple

For developers, the Harmony protocol is so simple writing a client is like child's play.
For users, the official clients are so simple and familiar you already know how to use them.

### Private

Conversations across Harmony belongs to you and your friends, not to anyone else.

### Shareable

Harmony lets you easily share your content on Harmony with friends.

### Open Source

Harmony was born in open source, and will be open source forever.
Strong licensing on the servers and clients, as well as the protocol documentation guarantees this.

### Secure

Harmony mandates HTTPS, and features many safety guards to make sure that you can trust the servers you're connecting and federating to.

### Global

Harmony allows you to communicate from any device anywhere, with all your messages where you left them on the server.
