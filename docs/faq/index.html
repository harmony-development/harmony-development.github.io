      <h2 id="what-is-harmony">What is Harmony?</h2>
<p>A chat protocol which:</p>
<ul>
<li>is split into communities which contain channels which contain messages</li>
<li>is defined entirely within the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Protobuf</a> format, using a simple <a href="https://github.com/harmony-development/hrpc">RPC mechanism called hRPC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-design-goals-of-harmony">What are the design goals of Harmony?</h2>
<p>Harmony&rsquo;s protocol is designed to be as straightforward and pragmatic as possible. We do not make attempts at creating a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; design philosophy which the entire protocol is forced to follow, instead implementing things that make sense as a single cohesive system. Time has proven over time over that design idealism is often a limiting factor in services.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-matrix">Why not Matrix?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We believe that Matrix&rsquo;s design philosophy works in many cases, but fails in terms of performance and handling large communities.</li>
<li>We believe that requiring all data to be transferred between servers for federation is inefficient.</li>
<li>Harmony allows clients to connect directly to foreignservers if they wish for reduced latency and stress on their homeservers.</li>
<li>Harmony wishes to represent many things that don&rsquo;t work well in Matrix&rsquo;s model of &ldquo;everything is a JSON message appended to a stream called a room.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Matrix is lacking in many functions we want from a chat service</li>
<li>Having an independent protocol allows us to move faster to achieve our goals compared to working on Matrix.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-not-revolt">Why not Revolt?</h2>
<p>Revolt is an interesting project, and we actually hadn&rsquo;t known about it while Harmony was under development. However, there are currently a few issues, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>No federation. The developers have stated that federation was too &ldquo;messy&rdquo; for a big chat app. We disagree.</li>
<li>It wants to be &ldquo;Discord but open source&rdquo;, we want to be more than that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-is-e2ee">Where is E2EE?</h2>
<p>E2EE is currently under development as part of our &ldquo;Secret Service&rdquo;
It is currently being worked on in a branch of our <a href="https://github.com/harmony-development/protocol/tree/work/e2ee">Protocol</a> repository and a library called <a href="https://github.com/harmony-development/lockdown">Lockdown</a>, which allows clients to implement E2EE trivially.</p>
<p>E2EE rooms adopt a different style from the rest of Harmony, allowing us to have all three by having a design specifically tailored to E2EE conversation: good performance, good security, good user experience.</p>
